# Name to Gender classsifier.

The **name to gender classifier** is a tool that classifies different names in different gender classes, namely - **Male or Female**.
Gender classification however, canâ€™t solely be done from the name but it can achieve a great level of closeness to the reality.
Prediction of gender based on Name, comes with a great complexity, it might be possible that the same name can be of a Male or Female based on the culture, continent, or the ethnicity. Name and
Ethnicity can be better pair of features to predict the gender of a person.
This project uses only the **sounds** that each name impart to, classify it as a male or a female.
### The python notebook is well documented explaining each of the steps. ###
Also the pickle files are the trained models using different sklearn classifiers.
